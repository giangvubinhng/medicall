ABOUT THE PROJECT
===================
Have you ever forgot to follow the medical prescription correctly? Have you ever worried about your beloved ones getting worse because of that reason? With multiple perscriptions, the chance of people failing to follow perscriptions is even higher. Up to 75% of people do not take their medicines properly which could lead to your disease getting worse, hospitalization, even death. Therefore, we have developed an app called Medicall to help people resolve this problem. 
For many people, remembering to take a daily medication can be the difference between life and death. Using Medicall app can help decrease that risk. We care about your health and well-being.


DESCRIPTION
==============
- When the users click on the app logo, it will lead to the log in page.
- The user will need to fill out the information (if they do not have an account).
- After providing all the information, the user can log into the app using email and password that they just created.
- The home page is in the form of calentor, images, and notes which makes keep them in track of taking medicines.
- In the case the users needs to see the doctor out of office hours, they can use Medicall to find the nearest emergency room in their areas.
- The user can also add, remove, or edit their prescriptions:
+ We also include and develop more feature like
+ User profile -> view, edit, update profile
+ Setting -> security, change password
+ Doctors' profile -> fill in, add, or remove doctorsâ€™ information
+ Help and support -> help the user navigate through the app
+ Health -> provide more information and suggestion to help the user aware of their health problems and protect their well being physically and mentally.

DESIGN DECISION
================
With in 24 hours, we have come up with a design, logo, basic function, and features for Medicall. In the future, we could develop more features like the ones displayed in the prototype and help more stakeholders like people with disabilities and people with language barriers to protect their health.
